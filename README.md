# ThoughtWorks-trains-diff
Shows differences before/after feedback for ThoughtWorks trains code.

Feedback from reviewers given during interview with Tracy (to fix):
- Node class shouldn't store both the nodes it's connected to and the nodes connected to it; only one.
- Unit tests are too bunched together; should break them up more.
